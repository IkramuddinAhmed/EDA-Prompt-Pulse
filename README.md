## Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) with AI Integration

### Overview of CEDS
The Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) is a strategic plan developed to promote regional economic growth and resilience. Crafted by Economic Development Districts (EDDs), it serves as a roadmap that reflects local economic conditions and leverages collaboration among stakeholders. A strong CEDS is critical for securing federal grants through the Economic Development Administration (EDA), making it a vital tool for under-resourced regions.

### CEDS Creation Process
The creation of CEDS involves data-driven analysis, including a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) assessment, stakeholder engagement, and compliance with EDA guidelines. The document comprises several key components:

- Summary Background: Overview of regional economic conditions.
- SWOT Analysis: Identifies internal and external factors influencing the region.
- Strategic Direction/Action Plan: Specifies the actions needed to address the SWOT findings, including timelines and stakeholders.
- Evaluation Framework: Measures the plan’s impact and effectiveness.

### Problem Statement
Many under-resourced regions face challenges in developing robust CEDS due to a lack of resources, expertise, and tools for data collection and analysis. The process requires significant research, stakeholder collaboration, and an understanding of complex economic factors, often resulting in initial drafts that fail to meet EDA approval criteria.

### Challenges:
- Resource Limitations: EDDs often lack the human and technical resources to perform comprehensive research, data analysis, and strategy formulation.
- Time-Intensive Process: Gathering economic data and creating a viable SWOT analysis is laborious, particularly for smaller districts.
- Alignment with EDA Framework: Ensuring that the CEDS document complies with the EDA’s evaluation framework is crucial for approval, yet difficult for under-supported regions.

## Proposed Solution: AI-Driven CEDS Generation

### AI Integration for CEDS Creation
This project aims to leverage generative AI and transformer-based models to streamline the CEDS creation process. By incorporating AI technologies, the team seeks to automate key aspects of data analysis, document generation, and alignment with EDA guidelines.

### Key Features:
- Predefined Fields Design: A structured input interface will allow EDDs to enter key regional information (e.g., economic data, SWOT inputs), streamlining data collection and ensuring alignment with EDA guidelines.
- LLM Integration: Large language models (LLMs) will process inputs and generate region-specific strategies based on a database of previously approved CEDS documents.
- SWOT Automation: AI will assist in the generation of SWOT analyses by gathering relevant regional data and generating strategic recommendations.
- Evaluation Framework Alignment: The AI tool will cross-check generated CEDS documents against the EDA’s evaluation framework, providing feedback to ensure compliance.
- Scalability: The solution will be scalable across multiple EDDs, allowing for regional customization and adaptation.

### Implementation Strategy
- Prototype Development: The first phase involves building a prototype that integrates AI with SWOT analysis and generates draft CEDS documents. The team will develop modular agents to manage data loading, analysis, and strategy formulation, ensuring scalability across EDDs.
- AI Collaboration: The project will implement cosine similarity to compare CEDS drafts with approved documents, focusing on key areas like climate resilience and equity.
- Feedback Loops: Planners will have the ability to iteratively refine their inputs based on AI-generated feedback, enhancing the quality of CEDS submissions.
- User Experience Enhancements: Front-end mockups and modular agent frameworks will provide users with an intuitive interface for data entry and strategy development.

### Market Research

#### AI Integration in Economic Development Planning
There is significant interest in applying AI to streamline data discovery and content generation in the CEDS process. The use of tools like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and cosine similarity for document alignment is growing, especially to ensure compliance with evolving guidelines​.

#### LLM-Based Solutions
Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, provide immense potential in automating the creation of CEDS documents. By integrating pre-trained models, planners can generate content based on historical best practices and align their strategies with EDA guidelines​.

#### Existing Tools & Gaps
While tools exist to assist with economic data (e.g., StatsAmerica), there is no current AI-driven solution that automates CEDS document generation and ensures compliance with the EDA’s framework. This presents a gap that PromptPulse aims to fill​.

#### Scalability Needs
AI-based solutions need to be flexible enough to adapt to regional-specific challenges while maintaining scalability across EDDs. By employing modular agents and LLMs, the system can be customized to meet the unique needs of each region​.

### Conclusion
This project offers an innovative solution to the challenges faced by under-resourced regions in creating effective CEDS. By integrating AI into the process, the tool will automate time-consuming tasks, improve document alignment with EDA guidelines, and enhance the overall efficiency of strategy development for economic growth. The AI-driven CEDS generator will empower communities to create strong, data-backed strategies, facilitating access to essential funding and resources for economic development.
