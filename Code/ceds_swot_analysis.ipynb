This analysis is aimed at encouraging critical thinking, gathering stakeholder and community feedback, and collecting qualitative data. It's important to ensure that the SWOT analysis aligns with other sections of the CEDS and that the identified items are actionable. The SWOT analysis should connect to the strategic action plan and address any equity challenges that may arise. For more detailed information on the SWOT analysis for the Indiana 15 CEDS, you may refer to Chapter Three: Regional Opportunities and Needs Assessment in the CEDS document.\", 'source_documents': [Document(metadata={'page': 3, 'source': '/content/indiana15_ceds_2023.pdf'}, page_content='4 |  INDIANA 15 RPC - 2023 5-YEAR CEDS \\nChapter 1 \\nIntroduction'), Document(metadata={'page': 5, 'source': '/content/indiana15_ceds_2023.pdf'}, page_content='reached over 120 people during the community meetings and nearly \\n200 survey responses.

The \\nprocess for developing the SWOT and the stakeholders involved are critical and should be noted \\nin the CEDS as an introduction to the SWOT analysis. Allowing a broad and diverse group of \\nstakeholders and community members to contribute their input to the SWOT analysis ensures \\nthat this component of the CEDS is representative of many different views. However, the SWOT \\nanalysis may result in particular challenges related to equity.  Below are some of these critical \\npitfalls of the SWOT analysis related to equity and tips to avoid them:  \\n \\nSWOT Pitfalls    Tips for Ensuring an Equitable SWOT  \\nItems in SWOT analysis do not align \\nwith other sections of the CEDS, \\nparticularly those items related to \\nequity challenges that might rely on \\nqualitative rather than quantitative \\ndata.  \\n  \\n• Connect SWOT to findings from data in the \\nSummary Background  \\n• Ensure the items identified in the SWOT connect \\nto the Strategic Action/Direction of the plan by \\nhighlighting opportunities that are actionable  \\nThe resulting SWOT does not'), Document(metadata={'page': 2, 'source': '/content/eda_ceds_guidelines_2023.pdf'}, page_content='US Economic Development Administration - 032823 \\n \\n3 \\n \\nhigh-level steps required to prepare a CEDS can be found in the Preparation section of this \\ndocument, EDA suggests contacting the appropriate EDA regional office (specific points of \\ncontact can be found on EDA’s website (www.eda.gov)) to learn more about the overall CEDS \\nprocess and additional resources and guidance available. \\n \\nFrom the regulations governing the CEDS (see 13 C.F.R. § 303.7), the following sections must \\nbe included in the CEDS document: \\n \\n1.
